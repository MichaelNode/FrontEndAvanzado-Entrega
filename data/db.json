      "description": "<div>As developers, there are lots of repetitive things we do every day that take away our precious time. Finding ways to automate and optimize those processes is usually very lucrative. Many times we find ourselves sifting through a program’s output looking for the relevant bits and manually moving them into a different file, changing all the capital letters from a sentence into lowercase, or removing all non-numerical characters from a file. The kind of boring, repetitive and error-prone tasks that can pile up if we do them by hand, and turn into a big headache.</div>",

And as tweets contain a limited number of characters, they are ideal for performing sentiment analysis and gauging what people are saying about a company or topic of interest. In this post I will outline the steps to set up a relational SQL database using an ORM, and show two methods for pulling and storing tweets from the Twitter API. The use cases for this type of task are virtually endless, so lets consider that we have an unhealthy (in more ways than one) obsession with PIZZA.</div>",
